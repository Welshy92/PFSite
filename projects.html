        <h3 class="my-h3">Windows Simplified - Project 1 (HTML & CSS Essentials). <a href="https://github.com/Welshy92/windows-simplified" target="_blank">Github</a> - <a href="https://welshy92.github.io/windows-simplified/" target="_blank">Live</a></h3>
        <p>I was tasked with making a responsive website. The Windows Simplified website is designed to be a responsive website allowing for viewing on various types of devices. It showcases some very simple tips that can help a user look after their computer and slightly increase their efficiency while doing some basic tasks.</p>

        <h3 class="my-h3">Rescue The Royalty - Project 2 (Javascript Essentials). <a href="https://github.com/Welshy92/rescue-the-royalty" target="_blank">Github</a> - <a href="https://welshy92.github.io/rescue-the-royalty/" target="_blank">Live</a> - <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/welshynator" target="_blank">Game Art</a></h3>
        <p>Rescue The Royalty at its core is a very basic version of what you would expect to see in the combat of a classic turn based JRPG game. It contains a few basic mechanics, such as HP, various attacks (some can do double, half or no damage at all depending on the enemy the user faces), and a basic healing spell. The aim is using a combination of attacks and healing to defeat the enemy before it defeats you. The game contains various random elements to keep the player guessing and offer some replayability. I have also created all the art assets myself using Pixilart.</p>

        <p>WoW AH Averages is a python terminal app that calculates the average prices of 8 different items on the World of Warcraft Auction House based on a users input of the prices. This can aid the user in setting prices on the items that will sell well but make a tidy profit.</p>

        <p>Everyday legends is a platform in which players of the game 'League of Legends' can post, like and comment about certain matchups or guides on a specific champion within the game.</p>

        <p>Heritage Housing is a project in which a ficticious friend has asked me to provide some insight on what sort of price they should be aiming to sell their recently inherited houses at. They also wanted to be able to predict what the sale price of a house within the area would be. This project uses a combination of data analysis and creating a machine learning pipeline to help predict the sale prices.</p>

        <p>Wager your Jedi skills with the retro-designed game Saber Scroll. Developed by Hackathon Team Burgundy Lightsaber during the May 2023 Code Institute Hackathon. I had my hand in various parts of this project, allowing myself to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript on various parts of the project. I also created the soundtrack (using Rytmik Studio & Ultimate) to the game and was responsible for its implementation. I also drew up all the wireframes and contributed to the README.</p>
